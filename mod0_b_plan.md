# Beyond Mod 0 Plan


Between the end of Mod0 and the begening of Mod1 I have a total of 10 days.  During the Mod0 phase I have been leaning heavily into the schedule I created to ensure I'm using my time efectivly and that I'm prepared both mentally and physically for what will come in the future modules.  I will use the time in the upcoming 10 days as follows.

* Health and wellness

Each morning (early) I have a two hour block alloted for fitnees. This includes my regular gym time and yoga. This is a continuation of a habbit I have long extablished.    

* Turing Time

A three hour block each morning (7-10) dedicated to continued practice (30+ hours of additional practice).  I plan to re-work each assignment from scratch to continue solidifying my current knowledge and practe syntax.  

* General House Cleaning

I have a handful of general tasks that need to be completed before begining Mod1. All of these tasks are scheduled throughout the mid-day period of 6 of the 10 days I have before Mod1. 

* Work Space

My work space is ready to go and I feel very comfortable.  I am waiting on the arrival of a keyboard which is expected well before Mod1 begins. 

* Meal prep and plaining

My three kids (teenagers) return to school the same week Mod1 begins.  My wife and I are very adept at managing the moving parts associated with meals and active kids.  We have regular meal plans that include the delivery of most groceries. 

* Afternoon Zoom

I have arranged to regularly meet with clasmates in the afternoon via zoom. I have found talking through assignments helps to internalize the material. I also enjoy the connection I am making with my classmates.   


* Quality Time (Family and Friends)

My family is very close and we love spending time together.  I have time set aside in the evening and on the weekends to specifically be with my family fully.  I am also scheduled to meet up with friends one afternoon before Mod1 begins to play some golf. 

* Reflection

Each day I have a bit of quiet and reflective time during yoga and daily park outings with my dogs.  These times have been something I have dedicated to maintaing for my mental health for many years now.  I love the seperation these times create for me. 

* Purpose and Dedication

I consider myself to be very disciplined on how I conduct my life.  I have learned a lot from both my time in the military and as a teacher about how to maintain excellence during dificult and demanding situations. I expect a lot from myself and am determined to give this program my full measure of effort for both myself and my family.  I know this program will be difficult and demanding but I am well prepared to take on the challenge.
